# cfmip-diagnostics-code-repository
This repository introduces cloud metrics/diagnostics and also provides programs to calculate them.
The metrics/diagnostics introduced here are published in papers which include results of multi-model analysis. By setting up 
this repository we would like to encourage climate modelling and diagnostic groups to both use the existing metrics and to provide additional relevant codes.

Repositories which are currently available are as follows: 

   * Simulation of ISCCP global cloud amounts (Klein et al., 2013) https://github.com/mzelinka/klein2013-cloud-error-metrics/wiki
   * Cloud Regime Error Metric (CREM) (Williams and Webb, 2009, Tsushima et al., 2012) https://github.com/tsussi/cloud-regime-error-metric
   * Cloud radiative kernels (Zelinka et al., 2012) https://github.com/mzelinka/cloud-radiative-kernels
   *  Zonal plots of GCM cloud and hydrometeor fraction compared with CALIPSO-GOCCP and CloudSat (Nam and Quaas, 2012) https://github.com/chriscnam/CFMIP_LidarRadar
