# cfmip-diagnostics-code-repository
This repository introduces cloud metrics/diagnostics and also provides programs to calculate them.
The metrics/diagnostics introduced here are published in papers which include results of multi-model analysis. By setting up 
this repository we would like to encourage climate modelling and diagnostic groups to both use the existing metrics and to provide additional relevant codes.

Please see the Wiki page for basic instructions how to build a repository.
