# cfmip-diagnostics-code-repository
This repository introduces cloud metrics/diagnostics and also provides programs to calculate them.
The metrics/diagnostics introduced here are published in papers which include results of multi-model analysis. For the 
moment they are based on the outputs from COSP, but any 
metrics/diagnostics related to clouds are welcome. By setting up 
this repository we would like to encourage climate modelling and 
diagnostic groups to both use the existing metrics and to provide 
additional relevant codes.
